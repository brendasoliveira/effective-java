    1.1. Static Member Class/Static Nested Class
        An ordinary class that happens to be declared inside another class, declared as static;
        It obeys the same accessibility rules as other static members;
        if accessed externally, requires the outer class name as part of the qualifying name.
        This class has the advantage of being able to access private attributes on the outer class
